    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/03/15/21/47/roses-4058079__480.jpg" alt="notebook surrounded by pink roses" class="granny" style="">
    <p>This blog was created in dedication to my great-grandmother Mary Hall. Born in the West of Ireland in 1852 she married young and had a wealth of children. Her avid skill for baking was documented in her brown leather notebook, containing an assortment of recipes. Mary's work was preserved through the generations and eventually made it's way into my hands. I enjoyed baking her recipes but it wasn't enough. I knew I had to honour my lineage and share these ancient food traditions with the world. Family recipes bridge the generations together, connecting us to our ancestors. In the words of novelist Laurie Colwin, 'No one who cooks, cooks alone. A cook in the kitchen is surrounded by generations of cooks past'.</p>
